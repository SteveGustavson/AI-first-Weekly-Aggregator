# AI-First Weekly Aggregator

A tiny full-stack app that aggregates AI-first product development updates each week from official blogs and research feeds.  
It de-dupes, filters to the last 7 days, caches on the server, and displays in a minimal React UI.

## Quickstart (local)
1. Install Node 20+ and pnpm.
2. In the repo root:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   pnpm dev
